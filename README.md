# Text-Analysis

This repo is for a course, Programming Languages, at the University of Missouri - Kansas City. 
The program must carry out a text analysis over that of a text-file input. (.txt) The aim of the project is to introduce us to using a *functional* programming language. Clojure was the default recommended language, however, Python is also recommended, provided that the program is done in a functional style. 
Given that I have more experience with Python than Clojure, I believe that I will attempt this program first via Python. However, I think it would be good to attempt the program with Clojure when there isn't a time-requirement for the project.
